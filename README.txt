This git repository contains script used in our study "Sensorimotor remapping drives task specialisation in Prefrontal cortex". Scripts are structured into jupyter notebooks focusing on different aspects of analysis.

"Response-switch" file contains notebooks used to analyse data from response-switch paradigm.
"Rule-switch" file contains notebooks used to analyse data from rule-switch paradigm.
"Simulation" file contains notebooks used to simulate recurrent neural networks in order to explain observations from the two previous analyses.

"DATA" subfolder regroups all scripts used to format data and export it into suitable file types for following analyses.

"Individuals" subfolder refers to scripts used to analyse data across individuals (Decoding and population representation geometry) and to obtain plots from figure 2.

"Pseudo_pop" subfolder refers to analysis scripts used to analyse data from pseudo-population, merging neurons across individuals.

Original data matrices from Reinert et al 2021 are available in .mat format in DATA/MAT
